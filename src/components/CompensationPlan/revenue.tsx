          VR’s/VBO’s main work is to sell IndusViva’s products to
          customers/consumers. Online retail through e-Commerce store link
          allows you to earn revenue without purchasing the products with own
          investment. Commission can be earned without adjoining a single VR, by
          building a strong customer base. Each direct seller earns 20% of the
          DP* by selling at retail price to the customers/consumers. The
          personal volume from retail sales counts towards direct seller’s
          activity requirement.
